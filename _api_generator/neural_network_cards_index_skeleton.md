## Index of cards for building neural networks

The [Create neural network](cards/createNeuralNetwork) card offers the possibility of opening an editor to create neural network structures by connecting a few cards.

The backend for building and training neural networks is based on [Keras](https://keras.io/), and almost every layer, constraint, initializer and regularizer has its corresponding card.

**Note:** the current version of Protopipe does not support the parameterization of neural networks yet, but this feature will be available in the future.
