### Inputs


* **Rate** --- [Float](types/Float)

  Between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop. The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.

* **Input** --- [NeuralNetworkTensor](types/NeuralNetworkTensor)

  Input of this layer.





### Outputs


* **Layer instance** --- [NeuralNetworkLayer](types/NeuralNetworkLayer)

  Instance of this layer. It can be wrapped using a Bidirectional or a TimeDistributed wrapper.

* **Output** --- [NeuralNetworkTensor](types/NeuralNetworkTensor)

  Output of this layer.






**Note:** the backend for building and training neural networks is based on [Keras](https://keras.io/). The documentation of this card is a variant of the documentation of its corresponding class.
