## Let's talk about the elephant in the room

Data scientists spend **massive** amounts of time on trivial tasks, such as:

* Writing scripts to prepare the data.
* Writing scripts to optimize parameters.
* Manually writing out their results in tables and charts.

**That's not research**. We must get rid of all the tedious work so we can focus on the things that really matter.

Protopipe is a general solution for data processing, model training and result analysis. All in one and **without having to write a single line of code!**

## Ok, but what is Protopipe?

Protopipe is a **web platform** where you can visually design a pipeline for your **machine learning** experiments and test it against any data you upload.
